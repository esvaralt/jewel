Take refuge in it; it has been here all along.

Multidimensional, persisting through kalpas,

time and space are its vehicles.

Be centered in it and through it.

Attune yourself through meditation to the multiplicities.

Chant your sangha into existence until you are all as one.

Speak from it.

Act from it.

Loving kindness has no bounds.
