Take refuge in it; it has been here all along.
Multidimensional, persisting through kalpas, 
&ensp; time and space are its vehicles. 
Be centered in it and through it. 
Attune yourself through meditation 
&ensp; to the multiplicities. 
Chant your sangha into existence 
&ensp;until you are all as one. 
Speak from it. 
Act from it. 
Loving kindness has no bounds.
